# monerod-docker

This is a customized monerod container image.

## Usage

I use the `latest` tag in the examples below, which is fine, but I recommend running a specific version like `ghcr.io/mkell43/monerod:v0.17.2.3`. The version tag reflects the version of `monero` used while building the container image.

If you're using something like [`containrrr/watchtower`](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower/) then you'll want to ignore my recommendation and use the `latest` tag. Or you know, just live your best life and do what you want.

### Optional First Step

| This is optional, but _highly encourage_. |
| ----------------------------------------- |

- Install [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) if you don't already have it.
- `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkell43/monero/main/cosign.pub`
- `cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/mkell43/monerod:latest`

This current method isn't sustainable as I don't use a git tag on the repo to tie a specific tagged version of the container image to a version of the public key. I'm working on it and will fix it up *soon*â„¢.

### Running the Container

- `docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -v bitmonero:/home/monerod ghcr.io/mkell43/monerod:latest monerod --rpc-restricted-bind-ip=0.0.0.0 --rpc-restricted-bind-port=18081 --no-igd --no-zmq --enable-dns-blocklist`

Above, I'm passing a number of arguments without any explanation. If you don't know what they are or what they do, you should totally check out the great documentation at the appropriately named [Monero Docs](https://monerodocs.org/interacting/monerod-reference/) site. **Pleas don't run things all willy nilly without knowing what you're telling it to do!** _Please._
